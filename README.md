A work-in-progress to use Neural Networks to recognize expert level moves in the game of [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/Go_(game)). So far the best network produced by this code has an accuracy rate of 3.5%, which should be drastically improved upon as the project continues.

The games used as training data for this project come from the [GoGoD](http://gogodonline.co.uk/) Winter 2010 edition. For copyright as well as size reasons, they can not be distributed with this project.

Instructions on running this project to follow as the project matures.
